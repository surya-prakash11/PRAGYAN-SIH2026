For example, the ignition temperature of paper is lower than that of wood." },
  { q: "Give two examples each of combustible and non-combustible substances.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Two correct combustible examples", marks: 1 }, { step: "Two correct non-combustible examples", marks: 1 }], answer: "Combustible: paper, petrol, wood, cotton. Non-combustible: brick, iron nail, stone, glass." },

These dissolve in water to form carbonic and sulphurous acids, so they are acidic oxides." },
  { q: "What is smouldering? Give one example.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Definition (combustion without flame, in restricted oxygen)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Valid example (glowing coal / dying fire)", marks: 1 }], answer: "Smouldering is combustion that takes place in the absence (or restriction) of oxygen, producing no visible flame. A glowing coal or a slowly dying fire is an example." },
  { q: "State any two precautions to prevent fire caused by electrical faults.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Use of insulated / fault-free wiring", marks: 1 }, { step: "Switch off power / fuse or MCB / avoid overloading", marks: 1 }], answer: "Precautions: use properly insulated and regularly checked wiring; fit fuses or MCBs and avoid overloading circuits. Never touch switches with wet hands." },
  { q: "Draw the three zones of a candle flame and label them.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Correct labelled diagram of the three zones", marks: 2 }, { step: "Correct names: non-luminous, luminous, outermost", marks: 1 }], answer: "A candle flame has (1) the innermost non-luminous zone, (2) the luminous (yellow) zone, and (3) the outermost blue zone. The diagram should show the teardrop flame with all three zones labelled." },
  { q: "Explain why hydrogen is considered the cleanest fuel.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Combustion equation / water is the only product", marks: 2 }, { step: "No smoke or toxic gas is released", marks: 1 }], answer: "Hydrogen burns with oxygen to form only water (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O). It produces no smoke, CO₂ or toxic gases, so it is the cleanest fuel despite its high calorific value (150 kJ/kg)." },
  { q: "What is spontaneous combustion? Give one example.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Definition (combustion without external heating)", marks: 2 }, { step: "Example (white phosphorus / dry hay or coal heaps)", marks: 1 }], answer: "Spontaneous combustion is the process in which a substance catches fire on its own, without being heated, because its ignition temperature is low. White phosphorus is the classic example." },
  { q: "Define the calorific value of a fuel and state its unit.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Definition (heat produced on complete combustion of 1 kg)", marks: 2 }, { step: "Unit: kJ/kg", marks: 1 }], answer: "The calorific value of a fuel is the amount of heat energy produced when 1 kg of the fuel burns completely. Its unit is kilojoules per kilogram (kJ/kg)." },
  { q: "Why is the outermost zone of a flame the hottest zone?", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "Complete combustion of fuel vapours", marks: 2 }, { step: "Sufficient supply of air in this zone", marks: 1 }], answer: "In the outermost zone, the unburnt wax vapours meet a full supply of air, so combustion is complete. Complete combustion releases the maximum heat, making this zone the hottest and giving it the blue colour." },

Explain the colour of each zone.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Correct labelled diagram", marks: 2 }, { step: "Names of the three zones", marks: 1 }, { step: "Reason for colour of each zone (dark / yellow / blue)", marks: 2 }], answer: "The innermost zone is dark (unburnt vapours), the middle luminous zone is yellow (partly burnt, glowing carbon particles), and the outermost zone is blue (complete combustion, highest temperature). A labelled teardrop diagram with all three zones must be drawn." },
  { q: "Explain the process of combustion with an example. List the conditions required for combustion to take place.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Definition of combustion", marks: 1 }, { step: "Valid example (candle, matchstick)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Conditions: combustible substance, oxygen/air, ignition temperature (any 3, each 1M)", marks: 3 }], answer: "Combustion is the process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat and light, e.g., a burning candle. Conditions: (1) a combustible substance, (2) presence of oxygen/air, and (3) temperature reaching the ignition temperature — commonly shown as the fire triangle." },
  { q: "Why is petrol stored in closed containers? Discuss the role of oxygen and ignition temperature in your answer.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Petrol is highly volatile and flammable", marks: 1 }, { step: "Vapours can mix with air and ignite", marks: 1 }, { step: "Low ignition temperature / spark risk", marks: 1 }, { step: "Closed container cuts air supply and holds vapours", marks: 1 }, { step: "Correct reasoning overall", marks: 1 }], answer: "Petrol is highly flammable with a low ignition temperature and gives off vapours readily. If stored openly, the vapours mix with air and a tiny spark can ignite them. A closed container restricts the air supply and confines the vapours, keeping the petrol safe." },
  { q: "A fire breaks out in a kitchen due to overheated oil in a pan. List the steps you would take to put it out and explain why water should not be used.", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Switch off the stove / gas", marks: 1 }, { step: "Cover the pan with a lid / wet cloth to cut air", marks: 1 }, { step: "Use a CO₂ fire extinguisher if available", marks: 1 }, { step: "Water makes oil splash and spread the fire", marks: 1 }, { step: "Correct reasoning overall", marks: 1 }], answer: "First switch off the stove, then cover the pan with a lid or a damp cloth to cut off the air. A CO₂ extinguisher may be used. Water must never be poured: it sinks, boils instantly, splashes the burning oil and spreads the fire." },
  { q: "Compare wood and LPG as fuels in terms of calorific value, pollution and availability. Which would you prefer and why?", marks: 5, rubric: [{ step: "Calorific value comparison (LPG ~50 kJ/kg > wood 15–25 kJ/kg)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Pollution comparison (LPG burns cleaner, wood gives smoke)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Availability / convenience comparison", marks: 1 }, { step: "Clear preference stated", marks: 1 }, { step: "Justified reason linked to above points", marks: 1 }], answer: "Wood has a low calorific value (15–25 kJ/kg), burns with smoke, and needs space and effort. LPG has a high calorific value (~50 kJ/kg), burns cleanly and is convenient. LPG is preferred because it is efficient, less polluting and easier to store and handle." },

Then 3b² = a², so 3 divides a² and hence a. Write a = 3c, then 3b² = 9c² gives b² = 3c², so 3 divides b too. Both a and b being divisible by 3 contradicts coprimality, so √3 is irrational." },
  { q: "Find the HCF of 96 and 404 using Euclid's division algorithm.", marks: 3, rubric: [{ step: "404 = 96 × 4 + 20", marks: 1 }, { step: "96 = 20 × 4 + 16 and 20 = 16 × 1 + 4", marks: 1 }, { step: "16 = 4 × 4 + 0, so HCF = 4", marks: 1 }], answer: "404 = 96 × 4 + 20; 96 = 20 × 4 + 16; 20 = 16 × 1 + 4; 16 = 4 × 4 + 0. The divisor at the step with zero remainder is 4, so HCF(96, 404) = 4." },

Justify.", marks: 2, rubric: [{ step: "Factorise the denominator (3125 = 5⁵)", marks: 1 }, { step: "Correct conclusion with the 2ⁿ5ᵐ rule", marks: 1 }], answer: "3125 = 5⁵, which is of the form 2ⁿ × 5ᵐ with n = 0 and m = 5. Hence 13/3125 has a terminating decimal expansion (0.00416)." },
